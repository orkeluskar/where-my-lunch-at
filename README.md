# Simple lunch finder

## Motivation for the idea

- Ever wondered where to eat?
- Ever had to just search for **places to eat**?
- Ever wanted to try some **new place** to eat?

This service is a one-stop to answer all of these questions.

Find places near you, add places you ate at, try new places to eat.


## Introduction

> This server makes use of following to solve the lunch finding problem

1. Yelp's [Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3)
2. [Node client](https://github.com/tonybadguy/yelp-fusion) for Yelp's fusion APIs
3. For simplicity purposes of this challenge I've used **in-memory datastructure** to **store user history**. **Instead of using Persistence layer** (SQL, NoSQL etc).


## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/orkeluskar/where-my-lunch-at.git
   ```
2. Install all the dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Get your Yelp's fusion API Key [here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app)
4. Create `.env` file to supply Yelp's API Key, with following content
   ```
   apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```
5. Run your app
   ```
   npm start
   ```
